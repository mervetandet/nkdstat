<p class="TXT-CO"><big class="calibre6">T</big>his book was conceived as an homage to an earlier W. W. Norton classic, <span class="ITALIC">How to Lie with Statistics</span> by Darrell Huff, which was written in the 1950s and has sold over a million copies. That book, like this one, was written to demystify statistics and persuade everyday readers that what they don’t understand about the numbers behind the headlines <span class="ITALIC">can</span> hurt them. I hope that I’ve done justice to Mr. Huff’s classic. In any event, I would be delighted to have sold a million copies fifty years from now! </p>
<p class="txt"><span class="ital">I am continually grateful to W. W. Norton, and to Drake McFeely in particular, for enabling me to write books that address significant topics in a way that is understandable to lay readers. Drake has been a great friend and supporter for more than a decade now.</span> </p>
<p class="txt"><span class="ital">Jeff Shreve is the guy at W. W. Norton who brought this book to fruition. Upon meeting Jeff, one might think that he is far too nice to enforce the multiple deadlines involved with the production of a book like this. Not true. Yes, he really is that nice, but somehow his gentle prodding seems to get the job done. (For example, these acknowledgments are due tomorrow morning.) I appreciate having a kind taskmaster to move things along.</span></p>
<p class="txt"><span class="ital">My biggest debt of gratitude goes to the many men and women who do the important research and analysis described in this book. I am not a statistician, nor am I a researcher. I am merely a translator of other people’s interesting and significant work. I hope that I have conveyed throughout this book how important good research and sound analysis are to making us healthier, wealthier, safer, and better informed.</span> </p>
<p class="txt"><span class="ital">In particular, I would like to acknowledge the wide-ranging work of Princeton economist Alan Krueger, who has made clever and significant research contributions on topics ranging from the roots of terrorism to the economic returns from higher education. (His findings on both of these topics are pleasantly counterintuitive.) More importantly (to me), Alan was one of my graduate school statistics professors; I have always been impressed by his ability to successfully balance research, teaching, and public service.</span> </p>
<p class="txt"><span class="ital">Jim Sallee, Jeff Grogger, Patty Anderson, and Arthur Minetz all read earlier drafts of the manuscript and made numerous helpful suggestions. Thank you for saving me from myself! Frank Newport of Gallup and Mike Kagay from the</span> <span class="ITALIC">New York Times</span> <span class="ital">were kind enough to spend time walking me through the methodological nuances of polling. Despite all of their efforts, the mistakes that remain are my own.</span></p>
<p class="txt"><span class="ital">Katie Wade was an indefatigable research assistant. (I have always wanted to use the word “indefatigable” and, finally, this is the perfect context.) Katie is the source of many of the anecdotes and examples that illuminate concepts throughout the book. No Katie, no fun examples. </span> </p>
<p class="txt"><span class="ital">I have wanted to write books since I was in elementary school. The person who enables me to do that, and to make a living at it, is my agent, Tina Bennett. Tina embodies the best of the publishing business. She delights in bringing meaningful work to fruition while tirelessly promoting the interests of her clients. </span> </p>
<p class="txt"><span class="ital">And last, my family deserves credit for tolerating me as I produced this book. (The chapter deadlines were posted on the refrigerator.) There is evidence that I become 31 percent crankier and 23 percent more exhausted when approaching (or missing) major book deadlines. My wife, Leah, is the first, best, and most important editor of everything that I write. Thank you for that, and for being such a smart, supportive, and fun partner in all other endeavors.</span> </p>
<p class="txt"><span class="ital">The book is dedicated to my oldest daughter, Katrina. It is hard to believe that the child who was in a crib when I wrote</span> <span class="ITALIC">Naked Economics</span> <span class="ital">can now read chapters and provide meaningful feedback. Katrina, you are a parent’s dream, as are Sophie and C. J., who will soon be reading chapters and manuscripts, too.</span></p>
