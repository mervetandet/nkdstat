<p class="FM-CO1"><a href="part0002.html#app_01" class="calibre3">Appendix</a></p>
<p class="FMCO-BY"><a href="part0002.html#app_01" class="calibre3"><span class="ITALIC1">Statistical software</span></a></p>
<p class="TXT-CO"><big class="calibre6">I</big> suspect that you won’t be doing your statistical analysis with a pencil, paper, and calculator. Here is a quick tour of the software packages most commonly used for the kinds of tasks described in this book.</p>
<p class="H3a"><span class="BOLD-ITALIC1">Microsoft Excel</span></p>
<p class="txt-fl">Microsoft Excel is probably the most widely used program to compute simple statistics such as mean and standard deviation. Excel can also do basic regression analysis. Most computers come loaded with Microsoft Office, so Excel is probably sitting on your desk right now. Excel is user-friendly compared with more sophisticated statistical software packages. The basic statistical calculations can be done by means of the formula bar.</p>
<p class="txt">Excel cannot perform some of the advanced tasks that more specialized programs can do. However, there are Excel extensions that you can buy (and some that you can download for free) that will expand the program’s statistical capabilities. One huge advantage to Excel is that it offers simple ways to display two-dimensional data with visually appealing graphics. These graphics can be easily dropped into Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Word.</p>
<p class="H3"><span class="BOLD-ITALIC1">Stata</span><sup class="calibre31"><a href="part0019.html#footnote-644-48" class="calibre3" id="footnote-644-48-backlink">*</a></sup></p>
<p class="txt-fl">Stata is a statistical package used worldwide by research professionals; its interface has a serious, academic feel. Stata has a wide range of capabilities to do basic tasks, such as creating data tables and calculating descriptive statistics. Of course, that is not why university professors and other serious researchers choose Stata. The software is designed to handle sophisticated statistical tests and data modeling that are far beyond the kinds of things described in this book.</p>
<p class="txt">Stata is a great fit for those who have a solid understanding of statistics (a basic understanding of programming also helps) and those who do not need fancy formatting—just the answers to their statistical queries. Stata is not the best choice if your goal is to produce quick graphics from the data. Expert users say that Stata can produce nice graphics but that Excel is easier to use for that purpose.</p>
<p class="txt">Stata offers several different stand-alone software packages. You can either license the product for a year (after a year, the software no longer works on your computer) or license it forever. One of the cheapest options is Stata/IC, which is designed for “students and researchers with moderate-sized datasets.” There is a discount for users who are in the education sector. Even then, a single-user annual license for Stata/IC is $295 and a perpetual license is $595. If you plan to launch a satellite to Mars and need to do some really serious number crunching, you can look into more advanced Stata packages, which can cost thousands of dollars.</p>
<p class="H3"><span class="BOLD-ITALIC1">SAS</span><sup class="calibre31"><a href="part0019.html#footnote-644-49" class="calibre3" id="footnote-644-49-backlink">†</a></sup></p>
<p class="txt-fl">SAS has a broad appeal not only to professional researchers but also to business analysts and engineers because of its broad range of analytical capabilities. SAS sells two different statistical packages. The first is called SAS Analytics Pro, which can read data in virtually any format and perform advanced data analysis. The software also has good data visualization tools, such as advanced mapping capabilities. It’s not cheap. Even for those in the education and government sectors, a single commercial or individual license for this package is $8,500, plus an annual license fee.</p>
<p class="txt">The second SAS statistical package is SAS Visual Data Discovery. It has an easy-to-use interface that requires no knowledge of coding or programming, while still providing advanced data analysis capabilities. As its name suggests, this package is meant to allow the user to easily explore data with interactive visualization. You can also export the data animations into presentations, Web pages, and other documents. This one is not cheap either. A single commercial or individual license for this package is $9,810, plus an annual license fee.</p>
<p class="txt">SAS sells some specialized management tools, such as a product that uses statistics to detect fraud and financial crimes.</p>
<p class="H3"><span class="BOLD-ITALIC1">R</span></p>
<p class="txt-fl">This may sound like a character in a James Bond movie. In fact, R is a popular statistical package that is free or “open source.” It can be downloaded and easily installed on your computer in a matter of minutes. There is also an active “R community” that shares code and can offer help and guidance when needed.</p>
<p class="txt">Not only is R the cheapest option, but it is also one of the most malleable of all of the packages described here. Depending on your perspective, this flexibility is either frustrating or one of R’s great assets. If you are new to statistical software, the program offers almost no structure. The interface will not help you along much. On the other hand, programmers (and even people who have just a basic familiarity with coding principles) can find the lack of structure liberating. Users are free to tell the program to do exactly what they want it to do, including having it work with outside programs.</p>
<p class="H3"><span class="BOLD-ITALIC1">IBM SPSS</span><sup class="calibre31"><a href="part0019.html#footnote-644-50" class="calibre3" id="footnote-644-50-backlink">*</a></sup></p>
<p class="txt-fl">IBM SPSS has something for everyone, from hard-core statisticians to less statistically rugged business analysts. IBM SPSS is good for beginners because it offers a menu-driven interface. IBM SPSS also offers a range of tools or “modules” that are designed to perform specific functions, such as IBM SPSS Forecasting, IBM SPSS Advanced Statistics, IBM SPSS Visualization Designer, and IBM SPSS Regression. The modules can be purchased individually or combined into packages.</p>
<p class="txt">The most basic package offered is IBM SPSS Statistics Standard Edition, which allows you to calculate simple statistics and perform basic data analysis, such as identifying trends and building predictive models. A single fixed-term commercial license is $2,250. The premium package, which includes most of the modules, is $<span class="ital">6,750. Discounts are available for those who work in the education sector.</span></p>
